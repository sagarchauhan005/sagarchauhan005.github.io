# General Repository Hygiene

- Do not generate any unwarranted or not-asked markdown file to summarize or document an action taken unless asked explicitly to do so
- Even if a markdown file is generated upon asking, it should always reside in the 'documentation' folder at the root of the directory and NO WHERE ELSE
- Even after that if the markdown file is generated and you are confused where to keep it, ask a question to where to store
- Do not create unnecessary .sh or shell scripts for every automation unless required and asked explicitly
- Whenever a front-end specific file changes are done, specially in css, js or tsx etc file, make sure to run the build again to reflect latest changes
