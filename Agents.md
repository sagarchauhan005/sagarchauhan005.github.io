# General Repository Hygiene

- Do not generate any unwarranted or not-asked markdown file to summarize or document an action taken unless asked explicitly to do so
- Even if a markdown file is generated upon asking, it should always reside in the 'documentation' folder at the root of the directory and NO WHERE ELSE
- Even after that if the markdown file is generated and you are confused where to keep it, ask a question to where to store
- Do not create unnecessary .sh or shell scripts for every automation unless required and asked explicitly
- [Most important] Whenever a front-end specific file changes are done, specially in css, js or tsx etc file, make sure to run the build again to reflect latest changes
- [Most important] Make a local commit after every changes you run as an agent, without fail for easy logs.
- All UI/UX design should be made in Shadcn or Tailwind only for any small module, or large feature
- The header, footer, logo, meta tags, etc should always be component based to re-use everywhere and make editing at single source
- All functionalities and design should be mobile and tablet friendly always, make decisions to prioritize this always
- Do not push the code to main branch without confirmation
- All error states should have clear focus on message and not allow user to get distracted from the message at any times
- All links for images, files or any static assets should always be referenced from a common config, array or some json that is easy to manage later
- The local build should always work on local files but the production or staging build should always serve from a CDN link and thus should be configured.
- The assets in public folder should at every build be synced to a cloud storage that is configured and only those cloud links should be used
- For all the features developed, tests should be written in parallel, follow TDD approach always
- Befor every commit, scan for sensitive files if any that is part of commit and suggest to remove that
- Alwauys follow the most common Design Principles in System Design such as : Separation of Concerns, Encapsulation and Abstraction, Loose Coupling and High, Cohesion, Scalability and Performance, Resilience to Fault Tolerance, Security and Privacy
- Always remember the idea is not just build anything but to learn also, so all your summaries should make sure that it teaches me something valuable, include a small nuggest of insight or learning for me always.
- If the change or feature make edits to both backend and front-end, update the tests for both or write if not available
- Every now and then run both backend and frontend tests to keep checking if all functionalties are working fine or not.
- For any 3P API integration, always create a mock-testing setup, manageable by .env variable to test the same without calling the API
- Since, I will always do docker based deployment, all my CI-CD pipelines should have front-end build done and synced to cloud storage during docker build stage only and not on CI-CD workflow stage and the front-end package may require composer or other setups too
- I will always use a reverse proxy setup with docker nginx to serve the app, so create the docker compose file setup accordingly
